    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <div class="row pt-4 g-5">
        <div class="col-7">
            <p>The last 7 years have been journey of self discovery, facing my challanges and growing through them. Finding myself in a career, following graduation, that was not matching my ambitions, not allowing me to utilise my strentghs and generally not championing an approach to innovate, I decided I needed to change despite going aginst the grain in that industry. Through different studies and jobs I broadend my professional expereience and discovered what was important to me. I done this through an impossibly difficult life situation with my young sister being diagnsed with cancer, battling it for almost 5 years and passing away at the start of this year. The situation demanded a lot of strentgh and aligninment of myself with what is important in life. I had to dig deep to face my own struggle whilst supporting my family. Through this immense challange I realised the only way I would be able to get through it and thrive was to face my challanges and address them through personal growth. Not least do I owe it to my sister. Over the whole expereince I found a number of things that helped me heal and grow. These include, psyscology, philosphy, meditation, health, exercise, and literature. Following my sister’s passing I knew I would soon have to return to my career. I took this oppertunity to map out all the professional reflection I had done over the years and find the career that was right for me. With no doubt, the tech field is the right fit for me for many reasons. Knowing I love to problem solve using creative thinking and that fundamentally my mindset is one of building, software devlopment preseneted it’s self as the ideal path for me. I have gathered a lot of wisdom about how to care for yourself, grow and find your purpose. I love to share this to help others with their challanges, and through this Heal Yourself & Move came to fruition.</p>
