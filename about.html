        <h4 class="pt-5">My Story</h4>
        <div class="pt-2">
            <p>The last 7 years have been journey of self discovery, facing my challanges and growing through them.
              Finding myself in a career, following graduation, that was not matching my ambitions, not allowing me to
              utilise my strentghs and generally not championing an approach to innovate, I decided I needed to change
              despite that being uncommon to do from that industry. Through different studies and jobs I broadend my
              professional expereience and discovered what was important to me. I done this through an impossibly
              difficult life situation with my young sister being diagnsed with cancer, battling it for almost 5 years
              and passing away at the start of 2022. The situation demanded a lot of strentgh and aligninment of
              myself with what is important in life. I had to dig deep to face my own struggle whilst supporting my
              family. Through this immense challange I realised the only way I would be able to get through it and
              thrive was to face my challanges and address them through personal growth. Over the whole expereince I found a number of things that helped me heal and grow. These include,
              psycology, philosphy, meditation, health, exercise, and literature. Following my sisters passing I knew
              I would soon have to return to my career. I took this oppertunity to map out all the professional
              reflection I had done over the years and find the career that was right for me. With no doubt, the tech
              field is the right fit for me with it's forward-thinking nature. Knowing that I love to problem solve using creative thinking
              and that fundamentally my mindset is one of building, software devlopment preseneted its self as the
              ideal path for me. I have gathered a lot of wisdom about how to care for yourself, grow and find your
              purpose. I love to share this to help others with their challanges, and through this my portfolio project Heal Yourself & Move
              came to fruition.</p>
