    Hiroshi Yoshimura is widely considered a pioneer of Japanese ambient music, a fruitful corner of ambient music that is a go-to for many seeking feelings of serenity and harmony. Yoshimmura’s speciality is the genre of Kankyō ongaku, or environmental music (soft electronic melodies infused with the sounds of nature) and his one of his most renowned offerings, Green, captures that sentiment as well as any production in the subgenre.  Field recordings are layered with soft and minimal notes to create a texture which unfolds in a sonic and effervescent soundscape effect. This provides an ideal setting to project your own feelings. The composers once described the album as relating to “the comfortable scenery of the natural cycle known as GREEN”, rather the colour itself. Composed during the 1985-86 winter, the recording sits as a stark contrast to busy city life of Yoshimura’s Japanese cities. Indeed, this incredible piece of meditation music has seen heavy rotation by us when racking up work-from-home hours during the pandemic. It also deserves play-back for deeper listening as well, we recommend taking a warm bath to its 46 magical minutes.

    DJ Python second album is a fluent experience of his self-proclaimed style, “deep reggaeton”. The whole album concatenate together to form one seamless blend of a single tempo that offers 48 of blissed out, laid-back, escape. Python’s invites you into his world as he see’s the music with the animated video that spans the entire album. The result multi-dimensional trip that will be sure to leave you with lower stress levels than you begun with. We can remember fondly rocking this one in a hammock in 2020 in absolute lockdown fashion.
