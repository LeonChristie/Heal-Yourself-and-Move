        <h4 class="pt-5">My Story</h4>
        <div class="pt-2">
            <p>I have always had an intrinsic ambition that has made me determined to forge a career that is inline with what is important to me. This has driven me on a pursuit where I have made brave professional choices along the way to finding the right fit for me. I now have done so in development and I couldnâ€™t be more excited to start.<br />  
              <br />  
              Growth, both personal and professional, is one of my core values so working in an environment where innovation and learning is highly regarded is imperative for me. In my experience in civil engineering I found the approach to be rooted in tried and tested methods, and in Transport Planning, to be more focussed on process rather than outcome, despite this significantly contributing to why poor outcomes in our built environment are more often the norm rather than the exception. This directed me to further education where I thrived in learning and applying forward-thinking principles. However, through Urban Design I was operating in what is a theoretical niche in the context of an industry prone to inertia, and I could not see a path for me. My PhD offered me a route to broaden my skill set and open the door to industries more correlated with my drive and attributes; however, my sister who was just a child, became seriously ill with cancer during this time making it impossible to meet the demands of a PhD whilst being there family. <br />  
              <br />  
              None of these chapters in my career were wasted experiences as each step brought its own element of self-discovery bringing me progressively in tune with my professional aspirations and the nature of work I enjoyed. I went through a period of deep reflection following the passing of my sister and decided it was right to follow my intuition and change fields despite years of honing my expertise in the built environment. I now come into development with a strong sense of purpose knowing that I am at my happiest when creating tangible things, especially when I am using my expertise to form a plan for the best solution of what I am building. I believe these characteristics, along with my interest in applying a diverse mix of mental models from schools of thought equips me to succeed in an industry that values problem solving through a creative lens. The substantial correlation between my strengths and the traits of a good developer feeds into the zest I have and I hope this can lead me to achieve things I am proud of.
